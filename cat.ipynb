    "# Schrödinger's cat\n",
    "\n",
    "In [quantum mechanics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_mechanics), **Schrödinger's cat** is a [thought experiment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thought_experiment) concerning [quantum superposition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_superposition). In the thought experiment, a hypothetical cat in a closed box may be considered to be simultaneously both alive and dead while it is unobserved, as a result of its fate being linked to a random subatomic event that may or may not occur. This experiment, viewed this way, is described as a paradox. This thought experiment was devised by physicist Erwin Schrödinger in 1935<sup>[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schr%C3%B6dinger%27s_cat#cite_note-Schrodinger1935-1)</sup> in a discussion with Albert Einstein<sup>[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schrödinger's_cat#cite_note-Schrodinger1935-2)</sup> to illustrate what Schrödinger saw as the problems of the Copenhagen interpretation of quantum mechanics\n",

As illustrated, the quantum description uses a superposition of an alive cat and one that has died.\n"
